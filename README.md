Homogenouous vectors for Lua 5.2
================================

Use luarocks to compile.

Supported C-types:
------------------
int, char, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float, double

Example usage:
--------------
```
local hv = require 'hv'
local x = hv.int( 10 )    -- 10 is the size of vector
local y = hv.int( 10, 2 ) -- 2 is fill value ( by default 0 so x elements are zeroes )	
x[1] = 5 -- indexing is 1-based
x[2] = 6 
local z = x + y
print( z[1], z[2], z[3] ) -- prints 7, 8, 2
```
Supported operations:
---------------------
	+,-,*,/
	.. -- concat two vectors
	== -- equality check, yields true only if all elements are equal

Limitations:
------------

It's impossible to initialize int64 and uint64 with large numbers ( more than 2^52 if lua_Number is 64-bit floating point )
